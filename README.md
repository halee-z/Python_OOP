What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which contain data and methods.

Think of it like this:

Just like a real-life object (e.g., a car) has properties (color, brand) and actions (drive, stop), a Python object has attributes (data) and methods (functions).
